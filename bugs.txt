uniq.c
======
1. Filter out repeated lines in a file (stdin)

2. Fixed size buffer, off by one string allocation

3. Provide a line that is longer than 63 characters, or provide a line such that the length causes the null terminator to meaningfully override the len variable.

4. The program works on small input sizes but not on large ones. 

5. Dynamically allocate memory per string, and malloc for len + 1

sort.c
======
1. Sort words in a file

2. Return buffer on the stack

3. Almost anything

4. The program returns garbled output or segfaults which is indicative of memory corruption. Simplying the magic line also yields a compiler warning.

5. Malloc and later free memory instead.
